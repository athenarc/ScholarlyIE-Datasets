An Annotated Dataset for Transformer-based Scholarly Information Extraction and Linguistic Linked Data Generation

The file contains a manually curated and annotated, multidisciplinary dataset of 15,262 sentences from research articles (abstract and main text) 
that can be used as a source for linguistic linked data and for fine tunning transformer-based classifiers that extract from scholarly publications three types of entities:

1) research methods, named entities of variable length,
2) research goals, entities that appear as textual spans of variable length with mostly fixed lexico-syntactic-structure, and
3) research activities, entities that appear as textual spans of variable length with complex lexico-syntactic structure

The dataset was created with Prodigy annotation software using the spans-manual recipie.
